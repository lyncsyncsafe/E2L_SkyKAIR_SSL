# Progress Report – Securing Digital Identity in Kodachi v9

**Securing Digital Identity: Inside Kodachi's Challenge-Response Authentication System**

As the lead developer for Kodachi Security OS, I'm excited to share progress on implementing a cutting-edge challenge-response authentication system that perfectly balances security, usability, and user privacy. This milestone reflects my commitment to building a secure, privacy-respecting platform for the upcoming Kodachi v9.

## The Architecture: Security Through Separation

The system employs a robust three-tier design to ensure clear separation of concerns and maximize security:

- **Client Frontend (Gambas):**  
  Manages user interactions and integrates integrity verification mechanisms to ensure that user inputs and display elements remain uncompromised.

- **Client Backend (Rust):**  
  Handles secure API communication and intensive cryptographic operations, providing a reliable and efficient foundation for the authentication processes.

- **Server Backend (PHP):**  
  Responsible for processing authentication challenges, managing sessions, and enforcing security policies through server-side controls.

## Key Security Features

### 1. Cryptographic Authentication Protocol

The system employs a proof-of-possession authentication mechanism:

- **Authentication Flow:**
  - Client initiates authentication by requesting a secure session from the server
  - Server generates cryptographically secure challenge parameters
  - Authentication tokens include both challenge data and CSRF protection
  - Multiple validation layers ensure request authenticity
- **Client-Side Security:**
  - Device-specific credentials are used to generate authentication proofs
  - Sensitive identifiers are never transmitted in plaintext
  - Cryptographic operations ensure data integrity
- **Server-Side Verification:**
  - Multi-factor validation of client proofs
  - Session tokens issued only after successful verification
  - Rate limiting and replay attack prevention
- **Security Benefits:**
  - Zero-knowledge proof principles - server validates identity without receiving secrets
  - No password storage or transmission required
  - Hardware-backed identity verification when available

*Note: Specific implementation details are proprietary for security purposes.*

### 2. File Integrity Verification

Before authentication, the system performs rigorous integrity checks:

- **Hash Verification:**  
  Files are compared against known-good SHA-256 hashes.
- **Version Verification:**  
  Software versions are validated against remote references to ensure consistency.
- **Signature Verification:**  
  Binary signatures are cryptographically verified to prevent tampering.

### 3. Security Monitoring Infrastructure

The system implements defense-in-depth security monitoring:

- **Kernel Integrity Protection:**
  Linux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG) monitors kernel-level operations and detects runtime modifications to critical kernel structures.
- **File System Integrity:**
  AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) performs cryptographic validation of system files and detects unauthorized modifications.
- **Audit System Integration:**
  Linux auditd captures comprehensive security events including authentication attempts, file access, and system calls.
- **Process Accounting:**
  System-level process accounting tracks application execution and resource usage through /var/log/pacct.
- **Connection State Tracking:**
  Netfilter connection tracking monitors active network connections and protocol state transitions.
- **Security Event Logging:**
  Centralized logging through the logs-hook service captures authentication events, integrity violations, and system anomalies.

*Note: This monitoring infrastructure focuses on security events and integrity rather than performance metrics. Additional tools may be installed separately for system resource monitoring.*

### 4. Session Security

Multiple layers protect user sessions:

- **Server-Side Validation:**  
  Sessions are validated with configurable expiration periods.
- **CSRF Protection:**  
  Integrated tokens defend against cross-site request forgery.
- **Atomic Heartbeat Mechanism:**  
  Regularly confirms session validity.
- **Rate Limiting:**  
  Prevents brute force attacks by limiting authentication attempts.
- **High-Entropy Session Tokens:**  
  Tokens are generated using 256-bit random data and stored securely (with permissions set to 0640).

### 5. Secure API Communication

All API interactions are safeguarded with stringent measures:

- **Request Signing:**  
  HMAC-SHA256 is used to sign requests.
- **Timestamp & Nonce Controls:**  
  Requests are time-bound and include nonces to thwart replay attacks.
- **Input Verification:**  
  Strict content-type checks and input validations ensure only sanitized data is processed.
- **Logging Practices:**  
  All sensitive data is sanitized before logging to maintain confidentiality.

## Final Thoughts

This milestone represents ongoing work toward a secure, privacy-focused authentication system for Kodachi v9. The implementation uses cryptographic proof-of-possession principles to verify identity without exposing sensitive credentials. Through multi-layer verification, secure session management, and comprehensive logging, the system aims to protect user privacy while maintaining security.

**Important Notes:**
- This is a custom authentication protocol designed specifically for Kodachi's threat model
- The system is under active development and subject to security review
- Production deployments should consider established protocols like OAuth 2.0, WebAuthn, or TLS client certificates
- Security through transparency - while implementation details are proprietary, the security model is open to review
