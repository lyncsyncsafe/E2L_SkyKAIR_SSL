# for no change at all. Measured 2026-08-19 on an installed VM: 148 MB of
# collected text and the run had still not finished after 15 minutes.
#
# The manifest records each file's size at the moment it was redacted. The
# sweep skips a file only when its size is UNCHANGED, so anything appended
# raw afterwards is still swept: the optimisation is fail-closed, an unknown
# or moved file is always redacted again.

#
# The manifest lets the final sweep skip a file, so a file may only be marked
# when EVERY byte in it arrived through redact_secrets. safe_exec appends, so
# if some earlier RAW write had already put unredacted bytes in the same file,
# marking it afterwards would skip those bytes forever.
#
# A source audit on 2026-08-19 found exactly one path written both ways
# (03-network/resolvectl.txt) and its two writers are mutually exclusive
# if/else branches, so the hole is not reachable today. This guard makes that
# a property of the CODE rather than of that audit: the file is marked only
# when it was empty before the append, or when the size it had before the
# append is exactly the size this run last recorded as fully redacted.
#
# Round 2 (inspector F9): the guard originally covered 2 of the 5 places that
# mark a file, and the other 3 were argued safe because each is preceded by a
# truncating ">". That is the same audit-shaped reasoning this guard exists to
# replace, and it silently stops being true the day someone changes a ">" to a
# ">>". All 5 now go through should_mark. The failure mode is fail-CLOSED and

        # authorization/cookie/session added: a Bearer or Basic header in a
        # service log or a curl trace is a live credential and was not
        # matched by any rule.

        # F21 SECOND MEMBER, 2026-08-19 (claude-bd5ebed0). The trailing class used to be
        # [^A-Za-z0-9_-], which EXCLUDES a hyphen, so the address did not match
        #     sudo routing-switch microsocks-enable -u <user> -p <password>
        # the Kodachi CLI that starts the proxy. That line IS captured, because the
        # ps grep in this collector matches on the `microsocks` substring. Its password
        # flag is also lowercase -p, which the raw binary uses for the PORT, so the two
        # forms need different value predicates rather than one flag list.
        # DISCRIMINATOR: a port is all digits, a password is not. `-p 9050` stays
        # readable; `-p Xy7QpLm2Zr9TvBn4Ke1WaS6d` does not.
        # EVERY RULE BELOW BINDS THE FLAG TO THE PROGRAM IN ONE MATCH. An earlier
        # version used a sed ADDRESS plus a separate s command, which reads as
        # "microsocks -P" and MEANS "any -P on any line that mentions microsocks".
        # A sed address is scoped to the LINE, not to the command that owns the
        # flag, so program-gating bounds WHICH LINES a rule considers and says
        # nothing about WHICH TOKENS on them it rewrites. Measured on this host,
        # that form destroyed real output through three separate gates:
        #     find /var/lib/mysql -name "*.err" -print  ->  -p[REDACTED]
        #     cp -pr /var/lib/mysql /backup             ->  -p[REDACTED]
        #     sshpass -V && rsync -p file host:/dst     ->  the FILENAME destroyed
        #     tar -kxf backup.tar -C /opt && which ss-local -> -k[REDACTED]
        # A BRIDGE is what fixes it: the flag must FOLLOW the program name on the
        # same line with no shell separator between them, so a second command on
        # the line can no longer arm the first commands rule.
        # THE BRIDGE MUST BE A TOKEN WALK, NOT A CHARACTER RUN. A permissive
        # [^;&|]{0,150} bridge is greedy and POSIX takes leftmost-LONGEST, so it
        # slides forward to the LAST occurrence of the flag on the line and /g
        # then resumes past everything it swallowed. The secret sits INSIDE the
        # bridge, the one region the rule is guaranteed never to rewrite:
        #     sshpass -p SECRET ssh -p 2222 host  ->  the PORT was redacted and
        #                                             the password shipped in clear
        # That is the canonical sshpass invocation against a non-default port, not
        # an edge case. Found by claude-2071644a, who applied the leftmost-longest
        # argument below back to the bridge itself.
        # So each bridge is a repetition over WHOLE TOKENS, and the token
        # alternation cannot match a token that begins with the flag being bound.
        # The walk therefore physically cannot step over the first such flag, and
        # leftmost-longest has nowhere further to slide.
        # Flags are split one per rule on purpose. A combined [Pu] class would
        # match greedily to the LAST of the two and /g would resume past it, so
        # the earlier flag would silently survive.
        # The sshpass bridge additionally refuses -f, -e and -d, which are the
        # three MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE alternatives to -p (file, environment, file
        # descriptor). A line carrying one of them has no sshpass password on it
        # at all, so without this the walk crosses into the NEXT program and
        # redacts its port: `sshpass -f /run/pw ssh -p 2222 host` lost the 2222.
        # That is destruction rather than a leak, and narrowing here cannot
        # create a leak because the excluded tokens exclude -p by definition.
        # Residual raised by claude-2071644a, who judged it acceptable; it was
        # three characters to close, so it is closed.
        # THE CONTINUATION TOKEN ALSO STOPS AT `<` AND `>`. Without that, the walk
        # eats a shell REDIRECT and leaves a dangling fragment:
        #   -P My Pass > /var/log/ms.log 2>&1   ->   -P [REDACTED]&1
        # No secret escapes, so this is destruction rather than a leak, but a
        # bundle reading `[REDACTED]&1` tells an engineer nothing about where the
        # daemon output went, and it looks like corruption. The exclusion is on the
        # FIRST character of a continuation token only: excluding <> from the
        # second class too would break a spaced password whose later word contains
        # `>` (`-P My Pa>ss`), which is a real shape and is tested.
        # Found by claude-2071644a, 2026-08-20.
        # THE VALUE IS MULTI-TOKEN ON THE FOUR microsocks GATES AND SINGLE-TOKEN
        # EVERYWHERE ELSE, and that asymmetry is load-bearing. A one-token value
        # ([^[:space:]]+) leaks everything after the first SPACE in a password,
        # and microsocks-enable takes `password: String` from clap with no charset
        # restriction, so a space is accepted and never warned about. The four
        # microsocks gates can swallow following NON-FLAG tokens safely because
        # their producer always follows the secret with a flag:
        #   microsocks.rs:192-199   -u user -P password -b 0.0.0.0 -p port
        # sshpass does NOT get this: it is always followed by a COMMAND, so
        # `sshpass -p SECRET ssh admin@host` would lose `ssh admin@host`.
        # The ss/obfs family does NOT get it either, and the reason is now read
        # rather than unknown: routing-switch starts ss-local with a CONFIG FILE
        # (protocols/clients/shadowsocks.rs:200, CONFIG_ARG plus a path), so this
        # product never emits `ss-local -k` at all and nothing establishes what
        # follows the key on a hand-typed line. Found by claude-2071644a.
        # KNOWN RESIDUAL, deliberate: a flag REPEATED on one command line is
        # redacted only on its first occurrence, because /g resumes past the
        # program name. Closing it needs a :label + t loop, whose termination
        # guard would require rejecting values that begin with [ and would
        # therefore open a new leak class. No producer here emits a duplicate
        # flag; ss-local -k A ... -k B is a user error, not a shape we ship.
        #
        # mysql/mysqldump/mariadb was REMOVED outright rather than repaired:
        # `mysql` is a directory name (/var/lib/mysql), a service name and a log

        # mysql client producer at all (the only repo hit is this file).
