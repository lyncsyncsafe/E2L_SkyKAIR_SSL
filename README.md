Each of the above components is now integrated or in final testing stages. Kodachi 9 will support both GUI-based control and CLI command-driven interaction. Further behind-the-scenes breakdowns, including architecture and modular execution flow, will be provided in a dedicated technical insight section.

## Development Approach

- **From Scratch with Legacy Integration:**  
  Every component has been re-engineered from the ground up to ensure modern, robust architecture. That said, the working code from the previous version was utilized where applicable to maintain proven functionality and save valuable development time.

## Next Steps

- **Kodachi Client-Side Script:**  
  Finalize remaining features and conduct thorough testing to ensure robustness before full deployment.

- **Kodachi GUI:**  
  Continue refining design and component integration (currently at 70%). Frontend functionalities are actively being implemented across modules.

- **Integration & Testing:**  
  Once all components are ready, integrate the GUI with backend systems and perform comprehensive system testing.

- **Documentation & Feedback:**  
  Update project documentation to reflect the current progress and gather user feedback for continuous improvement.

## Timeline

- **Short Term (Next 1-2 Weeks):**  
  Finalize Kodachi client-side scripts and prepare them for integration testing.

- **Mid Term (Next 1 Month):**  
  Complete 100% of GUI functionalities, finalize frontend development for pending modules (e.g., DNS, Settings), and begin full integration testing.

- **Long Term (1-3 Months):**  
  Conduct end-to-end testing, polish the system, complete ISO build, and roll out the public beta release.

Stay tuned for further updates.
