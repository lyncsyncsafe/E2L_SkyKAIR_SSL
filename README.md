Each of the above components is now integrated or in final testing stages. Kodachi 9 will support both GUI-based control and CLI command-driven interaction.

## Development Approach

- **From Scratch with Legacy Integration:**  
  Every component has been re-engineered from the ground up to ensure modern, robust architecture. That said, the working code from the previous version was utilized where applicable to maintain proven functionality and save valuable development time.

## Next Steps (Following Timeline Tasks)

- **Immediate Priority (Aug 12-17):**  
  Complete Card System decryption and patching (Task #1) to enable secure connectivity features.

- **Backend Development (Aug 17-21):**  
  Implement Project Connector in Rust (Task #2) and Blender backend system (Task #3) for advanced traffic management.

- **GUI Enhancements (Aug 21-31):**  
  Fix Tor Manager IP login functionality (Task #4), complete DNS GUI (Task #5), and implement Blender GUI frontend (Task #6).

- **Testing & Validation (Sep 1-10):**  
  Debug Gambas command line integration (Task #7), test all binaries (Task #8), verify legacy features (Task #9), and review documentation (Task #10).

- **Final Phase (Sep 10-22):**  
  Conduct comprehensive research and testing (Task #11), build and sign the ISO (Task #12) for beta release on September 22, 2025.
