# Linux Kodachi - Kodachi 9 soon üöÄ

**Linux Kodachi** is a **security-focused operating system** designed for users who value **privacy, anonymity,** and a **secure computing experience**. Developed by **Warith Al Maawali**, Kodachi provides all the tools necessary for anonymous online activities while maintaining ease of use. The current stable version is built on top of **Xubuntu 18.04.6** and further customized for enhanced privacy and security, while the upcoming **Kodachi 9** is being rebuilt from the ground up on a **Debian base** for enhanced performance and security. Kodachi serves as a **live system** that leaves **no trace** on the host machine.

## Features at a Glance

- üîí **Secure by Default:** Kodachi ensures that from the moment you boot up, you're protected. With a **pre-configured VPN**, **Tor network**, and **DNSCrypt** service, your internet traffic is encrypted and anonymized without requiring any configuration.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Privacy Focused:** All your online connections are routed through a multi-layered protection stack, including **VPN** and **Tor**, making your identity extremely difficult to trace.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Live System:** Kodachi operates directly from **RAM**, ensuring that no data is written to your hard disk unless explicitly saved. Once the session is over, all traces of your activity are erased.
- üåê **User-Friendly:** Kodachi is designed for users of all levels. Whether you're an experienced Linux user or a beginner, you can enjoy the benefits of Kodachi with minimal setup.
- üîë **Cryptographic Tools:** Built-in tools for **file encryption**, **secure email communication**, and **instant messaging** help you maintain control over your data and communications.
- üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Anti-Forensic Features:** Includes measures to thwart forensic analysis, ensuring your activities remain private even if your system is physically compromised.
- üìä **System Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring tools provide insights into your **network connections**, **system performance**, and **security status**.

## Release Plan Going Forward üöÄ

### Phase 1: Kodachi Binaries (Universal Linux)
**Target:** After binary testing completion (Task #4)  
**Description:** Release standalone Kodachi binaries that work on any Linux distribution  
**Benefits:**
- Fastest deployment to users
- Cross-distro compatibility testing
- Early bug detection without needing ISO builds
- Community feedback on core functionality

### Phase 2: Kodachi Debian Server
**Target:** 2 weeks after Phase 1  
**Description:** Terminal-based server edition with optional lightweight TUI  
**Benefits:**
- Smaller attack surface for security hardening
- Network and security module stabilization
- Core system testing without GUI overhead
- Foundation for desktop edition

### Phase 3: Kodachi Debian Desktop (Xfce)
**Target:** 4 weeks after Phase 2  
**Description:** Full desktop experience with polished Xfce interface  
**Benefits:**
- Incorporates all feedback from Phases 1 & 2
- Refined UX based on real-world usage
- Most stable and feature-complete release

### Why This Order?

**‚Ä¢ Binaries First** = Fastest way to get real-world coverage on any distro. We catch environment bugs early without rebuilding ISOs.

**‚Ä¢ Server Next** = Stabilize network and security modules on a smaller, lighter attack surface, and harden the core that the Desktop will use.

**‚Ä¢ Desktop Last** = Integrate user feedback, polish UX, and ship the full experience.

### What This Means for Users:

‚Ä¢ **Earlier Access**: Get features sooner with smaller downloads  
‚Ä¢ **Better Stability**: Desktop benefits from two phases of testing  
‚Ä¢ **Flexible Deployment**: Choose the edition that fits your needs  
‚Ä¢ **Community-Driven**: Your feedback shapes each subsequent release

### Notes:
‚Ä¢ The Server edition is not the final look - it's the backbone for Desktop  
‚Ä¢ All editions share the same core security and privacy features  
‚Ä¢ Binaries can be integrated into existing Linux installations

---

Each of the above components is now integrated or in final testing stages. Kodachi 9 will support both GUI-based control and CLI command-driven interaction.

## Development Approach

- **From Scratch with Legacy Integration:**  
  Every component has been re-engineered from the ground up to ensure modern, robust architecture. That said, the working code from the previous version was utilized where applicable to maintain proven functionality and save valuable development time.


---

## Why Choose Kodachi?

Kodachi was born out of a need to bridge the gap between **user-friendly operating systems** and the increasingly sophisticated world of **digital privacy threats**. With Kodachi, you can:

- üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Browse the web anonymously** through layers of encryption and the **Tor network**.
- üíæ **Leave no trace** on the hardware you're using, making it perfect for environments where **privacy is critical**.
- üîí **Use cutting-edge cryptographic tools** for secure communication and data storage.
