# 🚀 Tor-Manager: Major Update for Kodachi OS v9

 

---

## 🔧 Overview

The **Tor-Manager** has been completely rebuilt from the ground up in **Rust**, transforming how Kodachi OS handles Tor network operations. This upgrade replaces legacy shell-based implementations with a high-performance, secure, and extensible backend that gives users unmatched control, speed, and privacy.

---

## 🧠 Key Architectural Highlights

- **Rust Backend**: Built in Rust for speed, safety, and concurrency.
- **JSON API**: Every command returns structured JSON—ideal for automation or UI.
- **Security by Design**: Defaults to client-only mode with enforced anti-exit settings.
- **Modular CLI**: A single `tor-switch` binary controls all features and modes.

---

## 🔥 What’s New?

### ✅ Multi-Instance Management
Run unlimited isolated Tor instances:
```bash
sudo tor-switch create_instance secure
sudo tor-switch list_instances_with_ip
```

### 🌍 Advanced Exit Node Control
Select exit countries or regions:
```bash
sudo tor-switch set_exit_node ch        # Switzerland
sudo tor-switch set_exclude_node 14eyes
```

### ⚖️ Load Balancing Modes
Balance traffic intelligently:
```bash
sudo tor-switch set_load_balancing_mode round-robin
sudo tor-switch torrify_system_nftables_load_balanced
```

### 🔁 Automated IP Rotation
Schedule dynamic identity refresh:
```bash
sudo tor-switch update_ip_all_timer 1h
```

### 🧰 HAProxy Integration
Support for advanced proxy strategies:
```bash
sudo tor-switch generate_haproxy_config leastconn 9055
```

### 🔒 System-Wide Torrification
Route everything—including DNS—through Tor:
```bash
sudo tor-switch torrify_system_iptables_dns
```

### 🛡️ Hardened Security
- Enforced `ClientOnly 1`, `ExitRelay 0`
- Password-based access control
- YAML config protection & auto-migration

## 🎯 Example Use Cases

| Use Case              | Features Utilized                                  |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Geo-Streaming**     | Consistent hashing + country exit control          |
| **Audit Mode**        | Exclude surveillance nations (14-eyes)             |
| **Multi-App Routing** | Separate Tor instances per use (stream, browser)   |
| **Auto Privacy**      | Timed IP rotation with DNS over Tor                |

## 🧩 GUI & System Integration

- 📦 **Kodachi Launcher**: Available under Button5 + Tray Menu  
- 📊 **JSON Outputs**: Real-time metrics feed the Gambas GUI  
- 🔒 **Firewall Sync**: iptables and nftables support  
- 🧾 **Logs-Hook**: All actions are centrally logged  

---

## 📈 Performance Gains

- 🧠 Up to **10x faster** than previous shell-based version  
- 🧹 Resilient against race conditions, memory leaks, or stale configs  
- 🔁 Fast circuit regeneration & live status checks

## 🧵 A Personal Note from the Developer

This project—**Tor-Manager for Kodachi OS**—has taken nearly **12 weeks of continuous, intense development**, including countless sleepless nights. Every line of code, every edge case, every safeguard was carefully written and tested to serve one purpose: give users full, uncompromised control over their anonymity.

Although **Kodachi 9 is not yet fully complete**, I can confidently say that even at this stage, **what has been built rivals and surpasses many of the tools I’ve seen across other security and privacy-focused distributions**. What you see here is not a clone, not a script bundle—it’s a meticulously engineered system with **features I have yet to find anywhere else** in a privacy OS.

My vision is simple: **to give users real power, real transparency, and real privacy**. Don’t just take my word for it—test the tools, inspect the code, and experience the control firsthand.

By the time this project reaches final release, I am hopeful that **Kodachi 9 will empower its users** with tools that provide not just peace of mind—but operational superiority in today’s surveillance-heavy digital landscape.
