# 🛡️ Kodachi v9 – Behind the Scenes Progress

Welcome to the **Behind-the-Scenes** folder for the development of **Kodachi v9**. This space documents the ongoing engineering efforts, security architecture decisions, implementation strategies, and technical milestones shaping the next generation of the Kodachi Security OS.

Here you’ll find a collection of:
- 🔒 **Security design documents**
- 💡 **Architecture insights**
- 🎥 **Development videos and feature walkthroughs**
- 🧪 **Experimental notes and early concepts**
- 🧰 **Technical breakdowns of hardened components**

---

## 📌 Purpose

The goal of this folder is to provide **transparency and technical depth** into the decisions and challenges involved in building Kodachi v9. It's a **progress log** from the perspective of the lead developer, designed to share not only solutions, but the *thinking behind them*.

We believe security tools should be as open in design as they are strong in defense — this folder is part of that commitment.
